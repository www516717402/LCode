A string such as "word" contains the following abbreviations:

["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
Given a target string and a set of strings in a dictionary, find an abbreviation of this target string with thesmallest possible length such that it does not conflict with abbreviations of the strings in the dictionary.

// 这里表述不清楚，只要有数字就计做长度1，不进行每个数字的计算，然而每个字母都得计算
// 比如123ab=3 aaa333=4
Each number or letter in the abbreviation is considered length = 1. For example, the abbreviation "a32bc" has length = 4.

Note:

In the case of multiple answers as shown in the second example below, you may return any one of them.
Assume length of target string = m, and dictionary size = n. You may assume that m ≤ 21, n ≤ 1000, and log2(n) + m ≤ 20.
 

Examples:

"apple", ["blade"] -> "a4" (because "5" or "4e" conflicts with "blade")

"apple", ["plain", "amber", "blade"] -> "1p3" (other valid answers include "ap3", "a3e", "2p2", "3le", "3l1").
